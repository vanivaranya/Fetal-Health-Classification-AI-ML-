Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification

In this project, 
1. I performed EDA on the dataset

2. classified the CTG features across the three fetal health states - Normal(1), Suspected(2) and Pathological(3) using Logistic Regression Model with an accuracy of 87 %, highest among other models like KNN.
   
3. visualized the distribution of CTG features across the three fetal health states
and the relationship between different CTG features (e.g., acceleration, deceleration) and the three fetal health states
